DNS Query Packet Analysis

DNS Caching - When you already visit a website, the second response is called DNS Caching. The resolver loads up quicker

DNS Information is stored in the DNS Cache.

C:\Windows\system32>ipconfig/displaydns

Windows IP Configuration
  example.org
  ----------------------------
  Record Name....:example.org
  Record Type.....:1
  Time To Live....:7200
  Data Length.....:4
  Section.......:Awnser
  A(Host) Record...:93.184.216.34

TTL - The amount of tim DNS Information is kept in the DNS Cache.

This is done in seconds

  7200 Seconds / 60 seconds per minutes = 120 minutes
  120 Minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 2 hours 

DNS Forwarding

Internal DNS 

Too much network traffic - Duplicate Server, Update Config, Load Balancing 

DNS Forwarding - Forwards DNS records 

Forward DNS Queries to:
Different Internal Server - DNS resolution
Public or External DNS Resolver

Google Public DNS Servers:

8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 - Google's Public DNS - External DNS

DNS Forwarding - Alleviates the load over solving DNS queries from our main server to a different server that is dedicated for DNS resolution. The dedicated DNS resolver can then build up its DNS Cache, resulting in faster DNS resolution times.

DNS Security

Denial of Service (DOS) - Threat Actor sends multiple queries.
Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) Attack - Multiple threat actors or different services attack the same service.

Man-in-the-Middle or On-Path Attack
Whereby the threat actor will capture the DNS packet, change the IP address of the domain, so as to direct you to a malicious website. This is known as DNS spoofing. 

DNS Hijacking
The threat actor just redirects the DNS query to an entirely different malicious DNS server. This is DNS hijacking. 

DNS Cache Poisoning 
Threat actors gain access to the DNS server and also gain access to the DNS server and alter the DNS record swith malicious IP addresses.

DNS Cyberattacks
DoS/DDoS attack
DNS Spoofing
DNS hijacking
DNS cache poisoning

DNS Security 
Change DNS port settings
Standard port for DNS: port 53

Use multiple DNS servers for redundancy - Swaps to another during DOS/DDOS attack
Configure DNSSEC - DNSSEC is a security protocol that checks the authenticity of DNS queries using digital signatures. This way threat actors can't spoof the DNS packets and send users to malicious websites.

Use Firewall
Firewall is a device or system that you place in network to allow or deny traffic
Packet inspection 
Throttling (limiting bandwidth) 

Cyber Attacks
- DOS/DDoS attack
- DNS Spoofing
- DNS hijacking
- DNS cache poisoning
